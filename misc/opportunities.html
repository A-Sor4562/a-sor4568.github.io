<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Today's educational system can be transformed and expanded by the use of AI (artificial intelligence) tools like ChatGPT, 
which can benefit not only students but also teachers and higher educators. Many benefits can be gained in the field of 
education thanks to ChatGPT, including the ability to reduce bias, receive immediate feedback and explanations, and use virtual assistants.</p><br>



<!-- Reducing Bias Section -->

<h3>Reducing Bias</h3>
<p>One large opportunity with ChatGPT in education today is reducing bias in education resources and content. 
As humans, when writing texts and resources aimed at students, we can unintentionally create our own bias in 
the writing due to our human nature. Because of this, many texts given to students can be more one-sided, 
which can harm and hinder their education as they are not given a fully unbiased text. This is where AI can
 step in. </p>
 
 <p>Since AI tools like ChatGPT can be trained and fine-tuned, they can be used to go through educational
 texts and resources and filter out any biases they may provide. This can include addressing gender, racial, or
 cultural biases. It promotes fairness and inclusivity and offers a more just educational experience by 
 eliminating these biases and providing more objective texts for students and educators to learn from. 
 As Mhlanga (2023) states, "It is possible for ChatGPT to exhibit bias, particularly in the language that it was
 trained on." They also go on to state that “it is essential to make certain that ChatGPT and other AI systems 
 are conceived, developed, and used in a fair and non-discriminatory manner at every stage of the process”. 
 Talhive (2023) Supports Mhlanga’s statement and states as well that “it is crucial to implement bias detection 
 techniques and continually assess and refine the model’s responses” Ferrara (2023) also mentions that 
 “Biases can also be introduced through the algorithms used to process and learn from the data. 
 For example, if an algorithm places more importance on certain features or data points, it may unintentionally 
 introduce or amplify biases present in the data”. Fortunately, as Ray (2023) points out, “ChatGPT benefits 
 from ongoing efforts to minimise biases in training data, leading to more objective and balanced outputs” 
 which means this bias that can be shown within texts is increasingly getting removed which makes it better 
 for educators and students.</p><br>



 <!-- Virtual Assistant Section -->
 
 <h3 id="assistant">Virtual Assistant</h3>
<p>Another opportunity that ChatGPT provides in education is the opportunity for students to use a virtual assistant.</p>


<p>In education, each student learns differently, and since educators have to teach large groups of students, it can be 
hard to accommodate those different learning types, which can lead to some students' grades suffering. Students would 
learn things more quickly and with a better understanding if they started using ChatGPT as a virtual learning assistant, 
as it is tailored to their needs. Smith (2023) points this out by stating that ChatGPT can be used to “enhance learning in adult vocational education”.</p3>

<p>Alongside students, the usage of ChatGPT could prove beneficial to educators. 
With the assistance of ChatGPT, making lesson plans, marking students' work, and personal 
development within the teaching area would become easier and more proficient. By offering quality personalised support and resources, 
the use of ChatGPT as a virtual assistant could enhance students’ learning; providing both students and educators with convenient 
access to this assistance.</p> 

<p>As Firat (2023) points out, "With the use of user input, Chat GPT can adjust its replies 
and offer specialized advice and assistance. According to a user's learning objectives and preferences, Chat GPT might be used, 
for instance, to make tailored recommendations for educational products and sites." This highlights how ChatGPT is capable of 
providing customised recommendations to what a student needs. Additionally, Kasneci et al. (2023) suggest that "teachers can 
use large language models to create personalized learning experiences for their students. These models can analyze students'
 writing and responses, and provide tailored feedback and suggest materials that align with the student's specific learning 
 needs." This shows that ChatGPT can play an important role in supporting educators in their roles by helping them give 
 students the personalised help they need. Furthermore, Qadir (2023) emphasises that ChatGPT “potentially be used to provide a 
 virtual intelligent tutoring service, in which a student can ask questions and receive personalized responses and feedback”.  
 This further shows the potential that ChatGPT can bring to education by serving as a learning tool for both students and 
 teachers, allowing education to be more personalised.</p><br>



<!-- Instant Feedback and Explanations Section -->

<h3 id="feedback">Instant Feedback and Explanations</h3>
<p>Similar to the use of ChatGPT as a virtual assistant, it can also be used for instant feedback and explanations for students. 
As said before, due to the teacher having a large group of students to teach, it can become hard to get around everyone to 
assist with feedback and personalised explanations for their questions. Once again, ChatGPT can be used in this instance, 
with the ability to provide instant feedback to the user prompt as well as explanations and clarifications on many different
 topics.</p>
 
 <p>In a self-paced learning environment like at universities, the use of this feature can be very beneficial, as 
 students can get instant support whenever they need it and not based on someone's personal schedule. This can help students
 have a better understanding and grasp of the subject and a stronger engagement in classes.</p>
 
<p>According to Lo (2023), "As a virtual tutor, ChatGPT can assist students in online independent study by answering their 
 questions and enhance group dynamics by suggesting a discussion structure and providing real-time feedback." Further, 
 Baidoo-Anu and Ansah (2023) state that ChatGPT can "provide personalized tutoring and feedback to students based on their 
 individual learning needs and progress." Likewise, Zhai (2023) suggests that ChatGPT "can be used to analyze student 
 responses to assessments and provide feedback on their understanding of the science concepts they are learning, as well as
 identify areas of strength and weakness." These capabilities highlighted by Lo, Baidoo-Anu, Ansah, and Zhai show the 
 potential of ChatGPT to support student learning and bring a personalised educational experience.</p><br>
