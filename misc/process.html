<h1>Project Process Support</h1>

<p>Your team project has several stages, and the assignment process is supported by the linked resources in this mock-up site.

<p>This mock-up site is intended to support your team project so you can take this as a set of files and as a starting point and adapt it to your preference.</p>
<p>It is built on a W3C site tutorial so does not claim to be flash, but now has an image, not well presented, but at least the site uses HTML and has been styled with CSS &hellip;</p>
<p>And it has links, which you can take as a start for your site structure.  The <em>Process Support </em>Links provides guidance which will be needed for presenting your final project. </p>
