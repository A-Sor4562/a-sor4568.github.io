<h1>Technology Choices</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The implementation of ChatGPT within education brings opportunities and risks alike, but it also brings 
choices to consider for its design and implementation in society. These choices include increasing the 
model size and refining the training process.</p><br>



<!-- First Choice -->
<h2>First Option</h2>
<p>The first option to take into account for ChatGPT's design and application in society is enlarging the model.</p>

<p>It takes choosing a larger model, gathering and cleaning a lot of data, training the model, and making 
adjustments along the way to increase the model size. According to Zhou et al. (2023), "The primary method 
is to increase data, improve computation power, and design training procedures to achieve better results." 
Enlarging ChatGPT's model will help it better understand the user and provide more accurate and contextually 
appropriate responses. Babich (2022) mentions that if the model is increased to “the next level, it will be 
like a quantum leap in capability”. According to Wang et al. (2023), "a well-trained language model can serve
 as a powerful feature extractor."</p>
 
<p>The ability of ChatGPT to offer beneficial educational support to students and teachers can be improved by 
this advancement in linguistic understanding. Additionally, ChatGPT can comprehend more complex concepts, 
respond fully, and give users illuminating explanations thanks to the larger model size. As a result, teachers 
and students can receive more individualised support, which can encourage deeper understanding and user 
engagement while lowering the possibility of learning impairment.</p><br>



<!-- Second Choice -->
<h2>Second Option</h2>
<p>Another option to consider when designing and implementing ChatGPT in society is to improve the training procedure.</p>

<p>Improved data selection, data cleaning (by removing irrelevant information), and preprocessing 
(by converting the raw text data into a format that the model can easily understand and learn from) 
are all steps in streamlining the ChatGPT training process. By concentrating on improving the data selection, 
data cleaning, and preprocessing steps, the training process can be optimised to increase ChatGPT's 
functionality and value in educational settings.</p>

<p>It's crucial that the data chosen for the analysis is varied, pertinent, and covers a wide range of subjects 
and regions. By ensuring a comprehensive set of examples, the new model's ability to learn across various areas 
is improved. Eliminating irrelevant information from the data helps eliminate bias, and conversion of raw text 
data to a format that ChatGPT can understand is achieved through tokenization and numerical encoding.</p>

<p>These refinements in the training process result in fewer mistakes, improve accuracy, and yield higher-quality 
responses from the AI tool. Such enhancements make ChatGPT a valuable tool for educators and students.</p>

<p>As Kalla & Smith (2023) note, ChatGPT's training method enables customization for specific applications, 
such as language translation or content generation. Furthermore, Dai et al. (2023) emphasise the ability of 
large-scale pre-training to encode rich factual knowledge, enabling language models to generate text even 
in specific domains. These texts highlight ChatGPT's adaptability, indicating its potential for specialised 
applications.</p><br>

<!-- Conclusion -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Using ChatGPT in education comes with both risks and opportunities. Utilising this AI tool, ChatGPT can help 
reduce bias within texts, provide personalised support, give instant feedback and explanations for a large array 
of subjects, and improve the learning experience for both students and educators alike.</p>

<p>Even with these positive benefits ChatGPT can bring to education, it is also important to address the risks that 
come with the use of the tool. An overreliance on technology, academic dishonesty, data security, and unfair 
advantages are just some of the large risks it can bring.</p>

<p>By enhancing the tool's model size and refining the training process, we can mitigate the risks associated with 
ChatGPT's implementation and maximise its effectiveness in education. Responsible use and consideration are key to 
realising the potential benefits ChatGPT can provide to both students and teachers in today's increasingly online world.</p><br>
